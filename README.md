# Travelist
Our web-application acts as social media platform that encourages and gathers people who wants
to travel to the same destination into one place (in our app) where users can get advice, descriptions, and reviews from other travelers.  Users can make posts describing the trip they wish to make and provide details like destination,budget and time. Other users of the application can search by filters like destination ,budget and time and if they want to join. they can send a friend request to the post owner and chat to share ideas or travel together . Users can choose “guide “ feature so they can provide tourism guidance service to other users.
Moreover , users  can follow groups they are interested in where they can share reviews and information about a certain country. They can view companies’ programs and can book cycles .

On the other hand companies can create programs heading to a certain destination. Programs can have more than one cycle for users to book through the application.. Travelers can book entire program  from the comfort of their own homes, so airlines, local taxis, and other businesses have partnered with these companies.
